Advent of Code 2021 Problems
============================

These are solutions for all the posted problems from [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I used [Go](https://golang.org) as the implementation language.
Because I make use of [generics](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18#generics), Go 1.18 or later is required.

Each problem has its own folder with the problem description, input and solution to both parts of the problem.

To run the code:

```
$ cd probX
$ go run partY.go
```
